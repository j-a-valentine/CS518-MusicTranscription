## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have **Python** and **FFmpeg** installed on your system.

### Installing FFmpeg

To install FFmpeg, follow the instructions specific to your operating system:

- **Windows**: You can download the FFmpeg executable from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions provided.
- **macOS**: You can install FFmpeg using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Open your terminal and run the following command: ```brew install ffmpeg```


### Installing Python Dependencies

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. If you haven't already, you can create one using the following commands:

```
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv ```

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
